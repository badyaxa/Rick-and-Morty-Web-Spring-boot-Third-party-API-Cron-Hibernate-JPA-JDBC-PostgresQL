# Rick and Morty API
### Task: Create API. It should contain two methods:
1. The request randomly generates a wiki about one character in the universe the animated series Rick & Morty.
1. The request takes a string as an argument, and returns a list of all characters whose name contains the search string On a regular basis, the web application downloads data from a third-party service to the internal database. Implemented API requests must work with a local database (i.e. fetch data from a database).

### What to use:
1. You must use public API.
1. Cron job to implement data synchronization with Rick & Morty api.
1. Java, Tomcat, Spring Boot, Hibernate (Spring Data JPA is also ok), PostgresQL; Jetbrains IDE, Git
1. Requests must be documented using Swagger.

### Nice to have:
1. Tests
1. Docker
